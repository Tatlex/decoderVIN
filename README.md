## Attention!!!

Due to the fact that GitHub Pages works with static websites, there is an issue with `ReactRouter` and the broken URL-bar.
If you will use GitHub Pages link, the project will loaded from *404 Error Page*. You need to click on *Return to home page* button
and all will be work.

If you want to clone this github repo and compile the project, before compiling in package.json remove the third line 
                                    `"homepage": "http://tatlex.github.io/decoderVIN",`,
and then you can compile the project. Then all will works correctly.

## About this project:
1. This project allow you get the detailed information about your vehicle using your VIN code;
For decryption was used nhtsa [API](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/)
2. Search history can be tracked (up to 5 queries);
3. For the correct search, validation was used to help the user for normal decoding process;
4. You can view more detailed information about your vehicle on the *Vehicle Variable List* page.;
5. If you try to find a page that doesn't exist, you will see a *404 error page* from where you can return to the *Home Page*;

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
